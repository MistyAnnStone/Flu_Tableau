# Flu_Tableau
Using influenza data from the CDC, I analyze where and when outbreaks are likely to occur.

## Project Overview
• Motivation: The United States has an influenza season where more people than usual suffer from the flu. Some people, particularly those in vulnerable populations, develop serious complications and end up in the hospital. Hospitals and clinics need additional staff to adequately treat these extra patients. The medical staffing agency provides this temporary staff. <br>
• Objective: Determine when to send staff, and how many, to each state. <br>
• Scope: The agency covers all hospitals in each of the 50 states of the United States, and the project will plan for the upcoming influenza season. <br>

## Data Overview
• Influenza Deaths by State, Month and Year, and Age, is sourced from the CDC. It includes monthly death counts for influenza-related deaths in the United States from 2009-2017, broken into two categories: state and age category. This dataset has several missing data points, but the sample size is more than sufficient for the analysis. <br>
• Population data by geography is sourced from the US Census Bureau. This data set includes yearly population totals by county 2009-2017. Population in recorded in two categories: male and female, as well as by age group. <br>

## Results
* Flu season in the US is December, January, Febuary, and March.
* People over the age of 65 are particularly vulnerable to complications arising from the flu. 
* Medical Staff should be deployed to states with a higher proportion of the population over the age of 65. 
* Recommended staffing proportions are presented in the conclusion.

## Tools
I used Excel and Tableau for this project.
